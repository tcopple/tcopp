p(disclaimer). Nuwach is the transliterated hebrew word for rest. Prounounced noo`-akh it means "to repose, have reset, be quite". I find a dedicated period of weekly rest to be the most important spiritual discipline I maintain, outside of daily prayer. Biblically we're called to two objectives during a period of sabbath, rest (exodus 2) and rememberence (deuteronomy 5); I also make time for detailed scriptual exposition since I might not find time for that the rest of teh week. This series, hopefully updated weekly is my attempt to share that exposition.
