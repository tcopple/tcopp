h2. We could all use a variety of adjectives to describe ourselves and, in that regard, I'm no different. The thing about adjectives is that, at *best* they're non descript definitions that do little to dilineate one person from the others that described themselves likewise. At *worst*, they're divisive, exclusive ideas that often start with in stereo types and end in uninformed opinions. So instead of adjectives, I choose something else.

bq. I choose to stand for and support those of lesser acclaim than myself, whenever possible.

bq. I, by His grace, believe in God and it's daily, the hardest decision I've ever made.

bq. Physical competition is a motivating factor in my life, as well as a calming influence.

bq. When I want rest, sunlight, friends, and a margarita are the things I seek.

bq. I will soon be married to the most beautiful woman I know, as well as the most Godly.

bq. To me, there is nothing prettier than the Texas hill country at dusk and the sound of a million cicadas.

bq. Programming is what I do, it's not who I am.
