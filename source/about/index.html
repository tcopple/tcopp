    In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Some time after that he created me.
    I blogged a lot in college, then I took a break for a while, now I'm trying it again.

    There's likely to be a smattering of development, theology, basketball and beer talk here
    so excuse whichever parts of it offend you, hopefully none, and read the ones that don't. There are no comments
    because that just means moderation, filtering, and responding. All of those things make the
    list of things I don't want to do.
