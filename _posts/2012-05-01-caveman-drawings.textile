For those who don't know, for the next thirty days I'm doing the "caveman":http://www.paleoplan.com diet. This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while now, as I have a former colleague at "Factset":http://www.factset.com who's been eating this way for years. The final straw or straws, that moved me from thought to action was a series of tweets by "@jrvassar":http://www.twitter.com/jrvassar stating that he was doing a slightly modified verison of Paleo, more intended to cleanse the body, called 'Whole 30':http://whole9life.com/category/whole-30 . As far as I know nothing life changing happend to JR but his series of tweets prompted me to action. So after a month of talk and research, Madison and I started today!

Even after one grocery shopping trip, and one day of food I have some significant observations but those will come in follow up posts. For now, I feel great, and even if I quit half way through I've already discovered a new found love for Mangos that I never knew I had. I guess that means I would have been a jungle caveman.
