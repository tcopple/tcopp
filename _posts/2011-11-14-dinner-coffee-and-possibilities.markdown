"... when 'things' slow down." Mr. says to Mrs. before taking a drink of his before dinner coffee. The same one he's typically nursing during his courtesy chat on the 6:29 express.

"... Right now just isn't the right time, perhaps later." Justifying a desire unmet; traded for a few more weeks, months and years of couresty chats, before dinner coffees, and excuses. Slurp. Sigh.

"... I'm thinking in February." Mr. reasons. Which to me -- who's trying not to hear any of this because I might just blurt out what what my mind in screaming -- sounds like it's too far away to plan for but just far enough to be convincingly plausible.

"Sip...."

What's left unsaid but understood by Mr., Mrs., and myself is that the last time 'things' went slower than the day before was 9254 days before. Since then only Thorton Wilder can accurately explain how each new day looks the Sun in the face and screams "Look How Fast I Am", like a five year old trying on a new pair of sneakers.

"Sluuuuurrrrpppp..."

"That understandable. I've been meaning to say that I really like your pants where'd you get them?" were the next words Mrs. said. The very next words. The words that took the place of what should have been Boldness and Possibility and Courage. The words that confirmed that it's okay to wear the Badge of Busyness as long as you wear it with specific pants. I felt the urge to reach out and spill the before dinner coffee all over the pants of busyness.

"Sccccccchhhhhhhiiiiippp."  Urge subsided.

"Banana Republic" I replied, right before the awkwardness won out to electronics and I turned to watch the day run through the finish line.
