  <p>I listen to Matt Chandler, the pastor of <a href="http://www.thevillagechurch.net">The Village Church</a>, a lot. It started several years ago when I moved away from Texas and began my first adult job. When I found myself sitting at a desk for obscene amounts of my time. Being far from home and lonely, I longed to hear God in a familiar way. After spending a lot of time following Matt Carter, of <a href="http://www.austinstone.org">The Austin Stone</a>, during college; it was recommended that I try out Mr. Chandler.</p>
<p>In the first podcast of his I listened too he blasted his congregation for being a body of referee&#8217;s who blow their whistles but never actually play in the game. <strong>I was hooked:</strong> because I often feel like a whistle blower, not because I want to point out other&#8217;s faults but because I don&#8217;t feel like I have the time, opportunity, or know how to correct things. <strong>I was hooked:</strong> because it&#8217;s refreshing to sit under a pastor who&#8217;s fear of God is greater than their fear of man. <strong>I was hooked:</strong> because I felt like, up here in the great north east, I was losing my Texan&#8217;ness, and Matt Chandler was giving me a piece of it back.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how this story starts.</p>
<p>Today, years later, I still listen to Matt Chandler, almost every week. I&#8217;ve back tracked and listened to every sermon he&#8217;s recorded at The Village for the last 8 years. I have more of their sermons on my computer than they list on their website. And then I realized I had a problem. In my mind, I remember statements, phrases, and exegesis of scriptures from all those talks, but I can never remember which talk contains which content. I would reference something he said at bible study, or think on an application while I was on the train but not remember precisely which podcast had which information so I could show others.</p>
<p>Then my training kicked in. I asked:</p>
<p><em>What if I could catalog everything Matt Chandler he&#8217;s said and make it searchable on a website?</em></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I did. Thankfully The Village transcribes all their sermonst o pdf files, so I didn&#8217;t have to relisten to everything. From there it was pretty simple. A few tools, a couple rake tasks, two database models and some basic text using sphinx and I have a functinoal website where anything Matt Chandler has said from the stage of the Village Church can be search by text.</p>
