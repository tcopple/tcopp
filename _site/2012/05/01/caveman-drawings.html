  <h1>caveman drawings</h1>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, for the next thirty days I&#8217;m doing the <a href="http://www.paleoplan.com">caveman</a> diet. This is an idea I&#8217;ve been kicking around for a while now, as I have a former colleague at <a href="http://www.factset.com">Factset</a> who&#8217;s been eating this way for years. The final straw or straws, that moved me from thought to action was a series of tweets by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jrvassar">@jrvassar</a> stating that he was doing a slightly modified verison of Paleo, more intended to cleanse the body, called &#8216;Whole 30&#8217;:http://whole9life.com/category/whole-30 . As far as I know nothing life changing happend to JR but his series of tweets prompted me to action. So after a month of talk and research, Madison and I started today!</p>
<p>Even after one grocery shopping trip, and one day of food I have some significant observations but those will come in follow up posts. For now, I feel great, and even if I quit half way through I&#8217;ve already discovered a new found love for Mangos that I never knew I had. I guess that means I would probably have been a jungle caveman.</p>
