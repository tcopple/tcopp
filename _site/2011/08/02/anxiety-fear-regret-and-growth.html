  <p>I turned in my two weeks notice at <a href="http://www.factset.com">Factset</a> yesterday. Since that moment there hasn&#8217;t been a smell, sight, or comment that hasn&#8217;t triggered a special demarkation of thought. The last time I remember feeling this way was right before I left Austin to move to Connecitcut, to take the job at Factset. I tell people that I love change, when in reaility I love the idea of change. Change itself is heart wrenching. Please do not misinterpret me it&#8217;s not difficult in the way most percieve something to be difficult, it&#8217;s heart wrenching.  The only feeling I have to compare it to is that flood you feel when you realize you&#8217;re parents are, like you, growing older and every moment you spend with them suddenly becomes a memory you can&#8217;t let yourself forget. It&#8217;s nearly an overwhelming feeling.</p>
<p>Since I made the decision to tell Factset that I was leaving, before actually telling them mind you, there have been four emotions swapping themselves out in favor of one another.</p>
<p><strong>anxiety</strong> is tied to others. If I lived my life in a vaccum outside of peoples expectation&#8217;s and the burden of responsibilities, I don&#8217;t think <strong>A</strong> would affect me. As it is, there are expectations to meet: my parents, May, the colleagues I&#8217;m leaving, the managers I&#8217;m leaving, the people who are praying for me, and basically anyone who expects me to have completely thought this thing out, even though I don&#8217;t feel like I always have; just to name a few.  There are responsibilities to manage: how will this affect my relationship with Gd? How will this affect my relationship with Madison? Is it a correct to take a job in <span class="caps">NYC</span> knowing full well that my life will continue to be lived in Connecticut?</p>
<p><strong>regret</strong>, this is a difficult one to explain. I think most would be enticed to belive that I <strong>R</strong> my decsion to leave Factset. That&#8217;s hardly it. I <strong>R</strong> leaving the small joys of my life at Factset, I fully expect these joys to be replaced in my new job, but still there&#8217;s the interaction with coworkers, the work/life balance, the free lunches and the amazing benefits. Know that I&#8217;m a dead man walking at Factset, I find that those joys matter more to me, they&#8217;re more enticing now, and I <strong>R</strong> leaving them.</p>
<p><strong>fear</strong> is the equal and opposite reaction to excitement. I&#8217;m truely excited to start something new, to engage in a new environment, and to learn from new people. Yet, there&#8217;s  about the result of those same thoughts. What if I can&#8217;t handle the commute? What if this company doesn&#8217;t last more than six months? What if I flounder instead of flourish? What if I am pushing myself furthur from what I really want to become? <strong>F</strong> tempers excitement. I can be ready, I can be excited, but the possibility of failure isn&#8217;t comforting.</p>
<p><strong>growth</strong> is not necessarily the suffix of change. It can be, but it&#8217;s not guaranteed, not even a little bit. However, <strong>G</strong> is the product of introspection, self reflection, and gained understanding. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed learning about myself and others, and change is a match to my uneventful fire that forces me to understand my motivations. Thank Gd for that.</p>
<p>::<strong>edit</strong>:: Between the time I started writing this post, and the time I actually posted it, the sentimality has all but faded and the anticipation of newness triumphs in my heart once again.</p>
