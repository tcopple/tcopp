  <p>Every person, because of the atoning work of Jesus Christ, is adored and cherished by Gd. However, not every person knows what those sentiments feel like or have people around them who can translate those feelings into understanding. Luckily, I am not one of those unfortunate, aside from interacting with Gd through Christ on a daily basis, I had a grandmother who went to great lengths to show me her love, affection, and my worth.</p>
<p>When I was a child I spent at least a week out of my summer at my Dad&#8217;s parent&#8217;s, Da and Meme, house. We&#8217;d spend our days at Sea World, at the family owned machine shop, cooking dinner, and watching John Wayne movies. When I was very young Meme taught me how to make scrambled eggs for dinner, how to type on an electric type writer, that a pack of raisins will give you a quick jolt of energy, and that blue bikes are generally better for boys than pink bikes &#8212; think what you will.</p>
<p>While Da passed away, suddenly, more than a decade ago. Meme has gone to be with the Lord after several years of fighting illness and forty years of Type A diabetes. No one has ever covered me in praise and adoration the way Meme did, and her pleasure in me is the best metaphor I have for explaining the amount of pleasure Gd takes in me. Praise the Lord for her and her ministry.</p>
